            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Odette Sansom GC, MBE (28 April 1912 – 13 March 1995),</strong> also known as Odette 
                Churchill and Odette Hallowes, code named Lise, was an agent for the United Kingdom's clandestine 
                Special Operations Executive (SOE) in France during the Second World War. The purpose of SOE was 
                to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, 
                especially Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with 
                weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Sansom was the first woman to be awarded the 
                George Cross by the United Kingdom and was awarded the Légion d'honneur by France.
                <br><br>
                Sansom arrived in France on 2 November 1942 and worked as a courier with the Spindle network 
                (or circuit) of SOE headed by Peter Churchill (whom she later married). In January 1943, to 
                evade arrest, Churchill and Sansom moved their operations to near Annecy in the French Alps. 
                She and Churchill were arrested there on 16 April 1943 by spy-hunter Hugo Bleicher. She spent 
                the rest of the war imprisoned in Ravensbrück Concentration Camp.
                <br><br>
                Her wartime experiences and endurance of a brutal interrogation and imprisonment, which were 
                chronicled in books and a motion picture, made her one of the most celebrated members of the 
                SOE and one of the few to survive Nazi imprisonment.
